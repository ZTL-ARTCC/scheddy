## A note on support (read!)
Though ZTL does not provide any official support for Scheddy (we're just volunteers), the lead developer is happy to assist with any issues as they come up and we're usually pretty quick to fix any reported issues.
If you have any questions, concerns, or have issues setting up your instance of Scheddy, please head on over to the #scheddy channel in the VATUSA Discord server, which is currently the venue for this discussion.
If you don't have access, ping Tyler Donia in the vatsim.dev discord and I'll have you added.

**This is the only location where most important announcements will be posted.**
If you are setting up a Scheddy instance, even if not associated with VATUSA or another controlling agency, it is highly encouraged that you get yourself added to this channel to have access to these important maintenance announcements.
You do not need to be a VATUSA member or visitor to gain access; though you do need to have an active VATSIM account.
